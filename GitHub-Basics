Cloning the online repo to your drive to make additions and edits before saving them with a unique location and history back to the
file online.

### What ***IS*** Github?
Github is a free open source distributed version control system designed to handle the smallest and biggest and all in between sized projects
with speed and efficiency in a very organized and understandbale format

Github repository is where the work will be saved as origin and the file can be remotely opened on your computer.
Once opened alterations made can be add commit push  ACP to save the newest version which can then be opened up on another computer.
This allows multiple instances of the same file to bew worked oin simultaneously and collaboration to be executed in the most organized 
way possible. Each push saves a seperate version with a flow history you can see what changes were made , why they were with the commit,
and follow that branch or keep going on a seperate tree. Endless posssibilties all centered around easily identifiable history of changes, 
who made them, why.

Dont forget to commit ***WHY*** a change was made when you make them. This level of documentation removes all uncertainty and keeps
the project moving forward organized and synchronized to the highest possible level.
